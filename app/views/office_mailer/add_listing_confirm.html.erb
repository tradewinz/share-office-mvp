
<p>Hi <%= @office.contact_name %>,</p>

<h3>Thanks for using tradewinz to share your office!</h3>
<p>
  We’ll notify you as soon as someone requests your office – and we’ll highlight the folks that seem to best
  match your listing criteria.
  <br><br>
  We’ll also send you a weekly report on how many people review your listing, so you can assess how much interest there is.
  <br><br>
  As part of our commitment to trust and privacy on the site, we will not release any contact information until
  you tell us that you’d like to communicate with the requestor.
</p>
<p>Click <%= link_to 'View', office_url(@office) %> to see your listing, or <%= link_to "Edit", edit_office_url(@office) %> to update your listing</p>

<p>
  Cheers,<br>
  The tradewinz team
